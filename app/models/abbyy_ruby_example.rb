# Documentation available on https://ocrsdk.com/documentation/

require "rubygems"

# IMPORTANT!
# Make sure you have rest-client (see https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client for detaile) gem installed or install it:
#    gem install rest-client
require "rest_client"

require "rexml/document"

# IMPORTANT!
# !!! Please provide your application id and password and remove this line !!!
# To create an application and obtain a password,
# register at https://cloud.ocrsdk.com/Account/Register
# More info on getting your application id and password at
# https://ocrsdk.com/documentation/faq/#faq3

# CGI.escape is needed to escape whitespaces, slashes and other symbols
# that could invalidate the URI if any
# Name of application you created
APPLICATION_ID = CGI.escape("CR_Regulation")
# Password should be sent to your e-mail after application was created
PASSWORD = CGI.escape("4GSlgxh/Nctzb5tyLa3Ll81z")
# OCR SDK base url with application id and password
# Change to cloud-eu.ocrsdk.com if the application was created in US location
BASE_URL = "http://#{APPLICATION_ID}:#{PASSWORD}@cloud-eu.ocrsdk.com"

# IMPORTANT!
# Specify path to image file you want to recognize
FILE_NAME = "/home/manh/environment/my_first_project_vision/public/picture_samples/English/Handprint/label.jpg"

# IMPORTANT!
# Specify recognition languages of document. For full list of available languaes see

# Examples:
#   English
#   English,German
